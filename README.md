This repository provides the implementation of the fingerprint-specialized DDPM sampler used in our paper, based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) framework proposed by Ho et al. (2020).
The model is retrained from scratch on a subset of NIST SD 302 to generate virtual identity fingerprints with high structural fidelity.
